# Drupal 9 to 10 Migration

Migration is a key part of the Drupal ecosystem, and it is always evolving. With the release of Drupal 10, it's crucial for website owners to understand the process involved in migrating from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10. This article provides an in-depth look at the migration process, including the benefits of upgrading, key steps involved, and potential challenges.

## Why Upgrade to Drupal 10?

Upgrading to the latest version of Drupal provides several advantages. Drupal 10 offers enhanced performance, better security, and advanced features that improve the user experience. It also provides better compatibility with the latest versions of PHP and MySQL, which ensures your website runs smoothly. Moreover, upgrading to Drupal 10 ensures continued support from the Drupal community. Drupal 9's end of life is scheduled for November 2022, which means after this date, there will be no more updates or security patches for Drupal 9. Therefore, upgrading to Drupal 10 is essential to maintain the functionality and security of your website.

## Preparing for the Upgrade

Before starting the upgrade process, it's crucial to prepare your website. First, ensure that your website is running on the latest minor version of Drupal 9. This is because the upgrade path to Drupal 10 is only supported from the latest minor version of Drupal 9. Next, update all your contributed modules and themes to their latest versions. Most of these should already be compatible with Drupal 10, and those that are not should have a Drupal 10 compatible version available. Also, remove any deprecated code from your custom modules and themes. Drupal's upgrade_status module can help identify deprecated code in your custom projects.

## The Upgrade Process

The upgrade process involves several steps and should be done in a development environment first to avoid any disruptions to your live site. Start by installing the Upgrade Status module to check the readiness of your Drupal 9 site for the upgrade. This module will provide a report on the compatibility of your contributed and custom projects with Drupal 10. Next, install the Upgrade Rector module to fix any deprecated code automatically. After fixing deprecated code, switch the PHP version to the one required by Drupal 10.

Next, update your composer.json file to require Drupal 10 and run `composer update`. This will download Drupal 10 and update the dependencies. After this, run the database updates by executing `drush updatedb` and then the configuration updates by executing `drush config:import`. Finally, check your site to ensure everything is working as expected. If there are any issues, resolve them before proceeding with the upgrade on your live site.

## Dealing with Challenges

Despite careful preparation, you might encounter challenges during the upgrade process. One common issue is encountering errors during the composer update. This might happen if there are incompatible modules or themes in your site. In such cases, check the issue queues of the problematic modules or themes for solutions. If you can't find a solution, consider reaching out to the Drupal community for help. Another common challenge is encountering errors during the database updates. If this happens, check the error message and logs for clues on what went wrong and how to fix it. 

## Post Upgrade Steps

After completing the upgrade, there are a few steps you should take to ensure your site is running optimally. First, check your site thoroughly to ensure that everything is working correctly. This includes testing all your site's functionality and checking that all content displays correctly. Also, check your site's performance and optimize it if necessary. Additionally, update your backup and recovery plan to account for the changes made during the upgrade.

## Ongoing Maintenance

Upgrading to Drupal 10 is not a one-time task. Like all software, Drupal continually evolves, and new updates and security patches are regularly released. Therefore, it's crucial to stay on top of these updates to maintain the functionality and security of your site. This involves regularly checking for and applying updates to Drupal core as well as contributed modules and themes. Also, keep an eye on the Drupal community for news on upcoming major versions of Drupal, as these will require a more involved upgrade process.

## Drupal 10's Built-in Upgrade System

One of the new features in Drupal 10 is the built-in upgrade system. This system allows site owners to upgrade to new major versions of Drupal directly from the admin interface, without the need for command-line tools. This simplifies the upgrade process and makes it more accessible to site owners without technical expertise. However, it's still necessary to prepare your site for the upgrade by updating to the latest minor version and fixing deprecated code.

## Conclusion

While the process of upgrading from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10 might seem daunting, it's a necessary step to ensure your website stays up to date and secure. With careful preparation and by following the steps outlined in this article, you should be able to carry out the upgrade smoothly. Remember that the Drupal community is always there to help if you encounter any issues. By upgrading to Drupal 10, you'll benefit from the latest features and improvements, and ensure your website is ready for the future.
